#Smart Home Security System

The primary objectives of the system are:

•	Perform Face Recognition
•	Detect weapons in video stream
•	Send timely alerts triggered by sensors
•	Detect tampering of the system

The evaluation of the system was done by using simple metrics such as speed, latency, accuracy, etc. 

The model used for object detection in weapon detector can be found here-
